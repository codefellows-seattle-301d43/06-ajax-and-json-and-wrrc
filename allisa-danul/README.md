## Overview
We are pulling blog articles from an emulated JSON source.  From there, we are storing into local storage and displaying them onto the index page.

## Getting Started
Fork the lab, clone it onto your computer.  Ensure you are referencing the proper JSON source for your articles. Make sure the functions are being called in the approppriate order, keeping asynchronicity in mind.

## Architecture
We used JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, HTML, CSS, JQUERY.
